The description of kinematics comprises fore- and hindlimb movements as well as sagittal spine movements including displacement patterns of limb segments, their contribution to step length, and joint movements. The comparison of the contributions of different segments to step length clearly shows the proximal parts (scapula, femur) to produce more than half of the propulsive movement of the whole limb at symmetrical gaits. Basically, a three-segmented limb with zigzag configuration of segments is mainly displaced at the scapular pivot or hip joint, both of which have the same vertical distance to the ground. Two segments operate in matched motion during retraction of the limb. While kinematic parameters of forelimbs are independent of speed and gait (with the scapula as the dominant element), fundamental changes occur in hindlimb kinematics with the change from symmetrical to in-phase gaits. Forward motion of the hindlimbs is now mainly due to sagittal lumbar spine movements contributing to half of the step length. Kinematics of small therian mammals are independent of their systematic position, their natural habitat, and also of specific anatomical dispositions (e.g. reduction of fingers, toes, or clavicle). In contrast, the possession of a tail influences `pelvic movements9.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Hemi-parkinsonian rats have preserved postural reflexes but are impaired in initiation of voluntary movements. Surprisingly, these rats can walk and run, suggesting that they can access some compensatory strategy to overcome the rigidity in their impaired limbs. The purpose of the present experiment was to investigate the locomotor compensations made by hemi-parkinsonian rats by measuring the forces exerted by the limbs on the ground throughout the stride during trotting. Rats with unilateral dopamine depletion produced by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the nigrostriatal bundle were trained to run back and forth in an alley for food reinforcement. Ground reaction forces were measured in three orthogonal directions using a force plate embedded in the runway. Rats were also videotaped so that limb movements were synchronized with force recordings. Although locomotion was obviously impaired, the affected limbs could support weight and provide some braking forces. In addition, the impaired hindlimb provided significant propulsive force, and a relatively large laterally directed force. Analysis of vertical movement of the centre of mass suggested that the impaired hindlimb was being used partly as a spring. The most significant abnormalities were seen during the diagonal couplet of the impaired forelimb and the unimpaired hindlimb, partly reflecting the important compensatory role of the unimpaired hindlimb. These results demonstrate that this method is useful in the analysis of hemi-parkinsonian gait and provide insights as to how rats can use an impaired limb to produce weight support and propulsion.},

	abstract = {As a first step towards developing a dynamic model of the rat hindlimb, we measured muscle attachment and joint center coordinates relative to bony landmarks using stereophotogrammetry. Using these measurements, we analyzed muscle moment arms as functions of joint angle for most hindlimb muscles, and tested the hypothesis that postural change alone is sufficient to alter the function of selected muscles of the leg. We described muscle attachment sites as second-order curves. The length of the fit parabola and residual errors in the orthogonal directions give an estimate of muscle attachment sizes, which are consistent with observations made during dissection. We modeled each joint as a moving point dependent on joint angle; relative endpoint errors less than 7\% indicate this method as accurate. Most muscles have moment arms with a large range across the physiological domain of joint angles, but their moment arms peak and vary little within the locomotion domain. The small variation in moment arms during locomotion potentially simplifies the neural control requirements during this phase. The moment arms of a number of muscles cross zero as angle varies within the quadrupedal locomotion domain, indicating they are intrinsically stabilizing. However, in the bipedal locomotion domain, the moment arms of these muscles do not cross zero and thus are no longer intrinsically stabilizing. We found that muscle function is largely determined by the change in moment arm with joint angle, particularly the transition from quadrupedal to bipedal posture, which may alter an intrinsically stabilizing arrangement or change the control burden.},

	abstract = {A device to generate standing or locomotion through chronically placed electrodes has not been fully developed due in part to limitations of clinical experimentation and the high number of muscle activation inputs of the leg. We investigated the feasibility of functional electrical stimulation paradigms that minimize the input dimensions for controlling the limbs by stimulating at nerve fascicles, utilizing a model of the rat hindlimb, which combined previously collected morphological data with muscle physiological parameters presented herein. As validation of the model, we investigated the suitability of a lumped-parameter model for the prediction of muscle activation during dynamic tasks. Using the validated model, we found that the space of forces producible through activation of muscle groups sharing common nerve fascicles was nonlinearly dependent on the number of discrete muscle groups that could be individually activated (equivalently, the neuroanatomical level of activation). Seven commonly innervated muscle groups were sufficient to produce 78\% of the force space producible through individual activation of the 42 modeled hindlimb muscles. This novel, neuroanatomically derived reduction in input dimension emphasizes the potential to simplify controllers for functional electrical stimulation to improve functional recovery after a neuromuscular injury.},

	abstract = {Typically, active muscle force is calculated by subtracting measured passive force from measured total force for corresponding whole muscle lengths (standard method). From a mechanical point of view, this requires a parallel elastic component (PEC) that is arranged in parallel to both the series elastic component (SEC) and the contractile component (CC). From a morphological point of view, however, the PEC should be rather in parallel to the CC, and both in series to the SEC (model [CC]). In this study, we investigated the differences in active muscle force estimated with these two different approaches and their impact on the interpretation of experiments. We measured passive forces without stimulation and total forces during supramaximal stimulation of six cat soleus muscles in end-held isometric contractions from lengths near active insufficiency to lengths close to inducing stretch damage. The active forces estimated with model [CC] reach about 10\% higher maximum isometric forces and reveal about 10\% longer optimal lengths of the CC compared to the standard method. Model choice affects the interpretation of the physiological working range and residual force enhancement. The active force-length relationships of the contractile component determined with model [CC] agree better with the theoretical sarcomere force-length relationship.},
